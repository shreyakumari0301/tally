TRAVEL DETECTION
----------------
International transactions are automatically classified as travel.
Domestic out-of-state is NOT auto-travel. To opt-in, add merchant rules:

  .*\\sHI$,Hawaii Trip,Travel,Hawaii
  .*\\sCA$,California Trip,Travel,California

DISCOVERING UNKNOWN MERCHANTS
-----------------------------
Use the discover command to find uncategorized transactions:
  budget-analyze discover               # Human-readable output
  budget-analyze discover --format csv  # CSV output to copy-paste
  budget-analyze discover --format json # JSON for programmatic use

CUSTOM MERCHANT RULES
---------------------
~900 merchants are built-in. Add overrides in merchant_categories.csv:

Pattern,Merchant,Category,Subcategory
MY LOCAL CAFE,Local Cafe,Food,Coffee
ZELLE.*JANE,Jane (Babysitter),Personal,Childcare

Pattern syntax (Python regex):
  NETFLIX           Contains "NETFLIX"
  DELTA|SOUTHWEST   Either one
  COSTCO(?!.*GAS)   COSTCO but not COSTCO GAS
  ^ATT\\s           Starts with "ATT "

Use: budget-analyze inspect <file.csv> to see transaction formats.

```

## Your Tasks

When working with this budget analyzer, you may be asked to:

1. **Set up a new budget directory** - Use `budget-analyze init`
2. **Add merchant categorization rules** - Edit `config/merchant_categories.csv`
3. **Configure data sources** - Edit `config/settings.yaml`
4. **Analyze and fix uncategorized transactions** - Run with `--summary`, then add rules

## Understanding merchant_categories.csv

This is the main file you'll edit. Each row maps a transaction pattern to a category.

**Format:** `Pattern,Merchant,Category,Subcategory`

**Pattern** is a Python regex (case-insensitive) matched against transaction descriptions.

### Pattern Examples

| Pattern | What it matches | Use case |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| `NETFLIX` | Contains "NETFLIX" | Simple substring |
| `STARBUCKS` | Contains "STARBUCKS" | Simple substring |
| `DELTA\\|SOUTHWEST` | "DELTA" OR "SOUTHWEST" | Multiple variations |
| `WHOLE FOODS\\|WHOLEFDS` | Either spelling | Handle abbreviations |
| `UBER\\s(?!EATS)` | "UBER " NOT followed by "EATS" | Exclude Uber Eats from rideshare |
| `COSTCO(?!.*GAS)` | "COSTCO" without "GAS" | Exclude gas station |
| `APPLE\\.COM(?!/BILL)` | Apple.com but not /BILL | Exclude subscriptions |
| `^ATT\\s` | Starts with "ATT " | Avoid matching "SEATTLE" |
| `CHICK.FIL.A` | CHICK-FIL-A or CHICKFILA | `.` matches any char |

### Adding New Rules

1. Look at the raw transaction description from the bank statement
2. Find a unique substring or pattern that identifies the merchant
3. Add a row: `PATTERN,Clean Name,Category,Subcategory`

**Example:** If you see `"WHOLEFDS MKT 10847"` in a statement:
```csv
WHOLEFDS,Whole Foods,Food,Grocery
```

### Rule Order Matters

Rules are matched top-to-bottom. Put specific rules before general ones:

```csv
# Specific first
UBER\\s*EATS,Uber Eats,Food,Delivery
# General second
UBER,Uber,Transport,Rideshare
```

### Standard Categories

Use these categories for consistency:

| Category | Subcategories |
|----------|---------------|
| Food | Grocery, Restaurant, Fast Food, Fast Casual, Coffee, Delivery, Bakery |
| Shopping | Online, Retail, Clothing, Electronics, Home, Kids, Beauty, Books |
| Travel | Airline, Lodging, Car Rental, Agency |
| Transport | Rideshare, Gas, Parking, Tolls, Auto Service |
| Subscriptions | Streaming, Software, News |
| Health | Gym, Pharmacy, Medical, Vision, Fitness |
| Utilities | Mobile, Internet/TV, Electric, Water |
| Entertainment | Movies, Events, Activities, Attractions |
| Transfers | P2P, CC Payment, Investment, Transfer |
| Bills | Mortgage, Insurance, Tax |
| Personal | Childcare, Grooming, Spa |
| Cash | ATM, Check |

## Workflow: Adding Rules for Uncategorized Transactions

### Method 1: Using the discover command (Recommended for agents)

1. Run discover to find unknown merchants sorted by spend:
   ```bash
   budget-analyze discover --format json
   ```

2. The output includes:
   - `raw_description`: The original transaction description
   - `suggested_pattern`: A regex pattern to match it
   - `suggested_merchant`: A clean merchant name
   - `count`: Number of transactions
   - `total_spend`: Total amount spent

3. For each unknown merchant:
   - Review the suggested pattern and merchant name
   - Determine the appropriate Category and Subcategory
   - Add to `merchant_categories.csv`

4. Re-run to verify:
   ```bash
   budget-analyze run --summary
   ```

### Method 2: Manual inspection

1. Run analysis to find unknown merchants:
   ```bash
   budget-analyze run --summary
   ```

2. Look for transactions categorized as "Unknown"

3. For each unknown merchant:
   - Find the raw description in the statement file
   - Create a pattern that uniquely matches it
   - Add to `merchant_categories.csv`

4. Re-run to verify categorization

## Using discover for Bulk Rule Creation

The discover command is designed to help agents efficiently create rules:

```bash
# Get JSON output for programmatic processing
budget-analyze discover --format json --limit 0

# Get CSV output ready for import (just needs categories filled in)
budget-analyze discover --format csv
```

### JSON Output Structure

```json
[
  {
    "raw_description": "STARBUCKS STORE 12345 SEATTLE WA",
    "suggested_pattern": "STARBUCKS\\s*STORE",
    "suggested_merchant": "Starbucks Store",
    "count": 15,
    "total_spend": 87.50,
    "examples": [
      {"date": "2025-01-15", "amount": -5.50, "description": "Starbucks Store"}
    ]
  }
]
```

### Workflow for Agents

1. Run `budget-analyze discover --format json --limit 0`
2. Parse the JSON output
3. For each unknown merchant:
   - Use `suggested_pattern` as starting point (may need refinement)
   - Use `suggested_merchant` as the merchant name
   - Determine Category/Subcategory based on merchant type
4. Append rules to `config/merchant_categories.csv`
5. Run `budget-analyze run --summary` to verify improvement
6. Repeat until Unknown transactions are minimized

## File Locations

```
my-budget/
├── config/
│   ├── settings.yaml           # Data sources, year, output settings
│   └── merchant_categories.csv # Pattern → Category rules (EDIT THIS)
├── data/                       # Bank/CC statement exports
└── output/                     # Generated reports
```

## Travel Detection

International transactions are automatically classified as travel.
Domestic out-of-state transactions are NOT auto-travel (opt-in via merchant rules).

To mark domestic locations as travel, add patterns to merchant_categories.csv:
```csv
.*\\sHI$,Hawaii Trip,Travel,Hawaii
.*\\sCA$,California Trip,Travel,California
```

Configure home in settings.yaml:
```yaml
# Optional: specify home locations (for international exclusions)
home_locations:
  - WA

# Optional: pretty names for travel destinations
travel_labels:
  HI: Hawaii
  GB: United Kingdom
```

If `home_locations` is not specified, it's auto-detected from your most common transaction location.

## Statement Formats and Custom Parsing

The tool supports three ways to parse CSV files:

### 1. Predefined Types (backward compatible)
```yaml
data_sources:
  - name: AMEX
    file: data/amex.csv
    type: amex      # Expects Date,Description,Amount columns
  - name: BOA
    file: data/boa.txt
    type: boa       # Expects "MM/DD/YYYY Description Amount Balance" lines
```

### 2. Custom Format Strings (for any CSV)
Use a format string to specify column mappings:
```yaml
data_sources:
  - name: Chase
    file: data/chase.csv
    format: "{date:%m/%d/%Y}, {_}, {description}, {_}, {_}, {amount}"
```

**Format string syntax:**
- `{date:%m/%d/%Y}` - Date column with strptime format
- `{description}` - Transaction description column
- `{amount}` - Amount column
- `{location}` - Optional location/state column
- `{_}` - Skip this column

Position in the string = column index (0-based).

### Discovering CSV Structure

Use the **inspect** command to analyze an unknown CSV:
```bash
budget-analyze inspect path/to/file.csv
```

This shows column headers, indices, and sample data rows.

### Workflow: Creating a Format String for Any CSV

**Step 1: Inspect the file**
```bash
budget-analyze inspect data/newbank.csv
```

**Step 2: Identify the columns**
Look at the output and find:
- Which column has the **date** (and what format: MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, etc.)
- Which column has the **description** (merchant name)
- Which column has the **amount**
- Optionally, which column has **location** (state/country code)

**Step 3: Build the format string**
For each column position (0, 1, 2, ...), add:
- `{date:%m/%d/%Y}` if it's the date column (adjust format as needed)
- `{description}` if it's the description column
- `{amount}` if it's the amount column
- `{location}` if it's a location column
- `{_}` for any columns to skip

**Example:** A CSV with columns: Transaction Date, Post Date, Description, Category, Amount

```yaml
format: "{date:%m/%d/%Y}, {_}, {description}, {_}, {amount}"
#         col 0           col 1  col 2       col 3  col 4
```

**Common date formats:**
- `%m/%d/%Y` - 01/15/2024 (US format)
- `%Y-%m-%d` - 2024-01-15 (ISO format)
- `%d/%m/%Y` - 15/01/2024 (European format)
- `%m/%d/%y` - 01/15/24 (2-digit year)

**Step 4: Add to settings.yaml and run**
```bash
budget-analyze run
```

Transaction descriptions look like:
- AMEX: `"NETFLIX.COM"`, `"UBER *EATS"`, `"STARBUCKS STORE 12345 SEATTLE WA"`
- BOA: `"NETFLIX.COM DES:RECURRING ID:xxx"`, `"ZELLE TO JOHN DOE"`

## Common Tasks

### Task: User wants to analyze their spending
1. Ensure `config/settings.yaml` has correct data sources
2. Run `budget-analyze run`
3. Open the HTML report in `output/`

### Task: User has many "Unknown" transactions
1. Run `budget-analyze discover --format json` to get unknowns sorted by spend
2. For each unknown merchant, determine appropriate Category/Subcategory
3. Add patterns to `merchant_categories.csv`
4. Run `budget-analyze run --summary` to verify improvement
5. Repeat until unknowns are minimized

### Task: User wants to track a specific merchant
1. Get the exact description from their statement
2. Create a pattern that matches it
3. Add to `merchant_categories.csv` with appropriate category

### Task: User wants to separate Costco groceries from Costco gas
```csv
COSTCO\\s*GAS,Costco Gas,Transport,Gas
COSTCO(?!\\s*GAS),Costco,Food,Grocery
```
(Gas rule must come first)

## Tips

- Run `budget-analyze` with no args to see help
- Test regex patterns at regex101.com (Python flavor)
- Comments start with `#` in CSV files
- Escape special regex chars: `\\.` for literal dot, `\\*` for literal asterisk
- The tool cleans common prefixes (APLPAY, SQ*, TST*) automatically

## Real-World Workflow Example

Here's a typical workflow when analyzing a new year's spending data:

### 1. Check for existing config
```bash
# Look for existing configs from other years to reuse
ls ../2024/config/ ../2025/config/ 2>/dev/null
```

### 2. Examine statement file formats
The tool expects specific formats. Your files may need transformation:

**Expected AMEX format (CSV):**
```csv
Date,Description,Amount
01/15/2024,AMAZON.COM,-45.99
01/16/2024,STARBUCKS STORE 12345,-6.50
```

**Expected BOA format (TXT, space-separated):**
```
01/15/2024 NETFLIX.COM DES:RECURRING -15.99 1234.56
01/16/2024 ZELLE TO JOHN DOE -100.00 1134.56
```

### 3. Transform data if needed
If your statement files have different formats, transform them with Python:

**Example: Transform multi-line AMEX export:**
```python
import csv
with open('Amex_raw.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    # Extract date, description, amount from your specific format
    # Write to clean CSV with Date,Description,Amount columns
```

**Example: Transform BOA CSV to TXT:**
```python
import csv
with open('BOA.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    with open('data/boa_clean.txt', 'w') as out:
        for row in reader:
            # Format: MM/DD/YYYY Description Amount Balance
            out.write(f"{row['Date']} {row['Description']} {row['Amount']} {row['Balance']}\\n")
```

### 4. Copy existing merchant categories
If another year has good patterns, start with those:
```bash
cp ../2025/config/merchant_categories.csv config/
```

### 5. Run analysis and iterate
```bash
# Initial run - will have many "Unknown"
budget-analyze run

# Check what's unknown
budget-analyze run --summary --category Unknown

# Extract unique unknown patterns for analysis
python3 << 'EOF'
import csv
unknowns = {}
with open('output/transactions.csv') as f:  # or parse from summary
    # Group by description pattern, sum amounts
    pass
# Print top unknowns by spend
EOF
```

### 6. Add patterns in batches
Add patterns for the highest-spend unknowns first:

```csv
# High-value unknowns from 2024
BMWFINANCIAL|BMW FINANCIAL,BMW Financial Services,Bills,Auto Loan
ASHTON BELLEVUE,Ashton Apartments (Rent),Bills,Rent
MICROSOFT DES:EDIPAYMENT,Microsoft Payroll,Income,Salary
```

### 7. Iterate until Unknown < 5%
Re-run after each batch of patterns until categorization rate is acceptable:
```bash
budget-analyze run  # Check Unknown total
# Add more patterns
budget-analyze run  # Verify improvement
```

### Common Data Issues

**BOA files with summary headers:**
```python
# Skip header rows before the actual data
for row in reader:
    if row['Date'] and '/' in row['Date']:  # Skip summary rows
        # Process transaction
```

**AMEX multi-line format:**
Each transaction may span multiple lines. Look for date patterns to identify record boundaries.

**CHECKCARD prefix in BOA:**
BOA often prefixes with "CHECKCARD": add patterns like `CHECKCARD.*STARBUCKS`

**State/location suffixes:**
Descriptions often end with location: `STARBUCKS SEATTLE WA` - the tool handles this automatically.

STARTER_CLAUDE_MD = '''# CLAUDE.md - Instructions for Claude Code

This file provides context for Claude Code when working in this budget directory.

## Project Overview

This is a personal budget analysis directory using the `budget-analyze` CLI tool.
The tool categorizes bank/credit card transactions and generates spending reports.

## Key Commands

```bash
# Run analysis (uses ./config by default)
budget-analyze run

# Show summary only (good for checking Unknown transactions)
budget-analyze run --summary

# Run with specific config directory
budget-analyze run ./path/to/config

# Initialize a new budget directory
budget-analyze init

# Discover unknown merchants (KEY FOR CLASSIFICATION)
budget-analyze discover                # Human-readable
budget-analyze discover --format json  # For programmatic use
budget-analyze discover --format csv   # Ready to copy into rules

# Inspect a CSV to determine its format
budget-analyze inspect data/file.csv
```

## Directory Structure

```
.
├── config/
│   ├── settings.yaml           # Data sources and settings
│   └── merchant_categories.csv # Pattern matching rules (MAIN FILE TO EDIT)
├── data/                       # Statement files (DO NOT commit - contains PII)
└── output/                     # Generated reports
```

## Primary Task: Classifying Unknown Merchants

When asked to improve categorization:

1. Run `budget-analyze discover --format json` to find unknown merchants sorted by spend
2. For each unknown merchant:
   - Identify what the merchant is (restaurant, store, subscription, etc.)
   - Determine appropriate Category and Subcategory
   - Create a regex pattern that matches the transaction description
3. Add rules to `config/merchant_categories.csv`
4. Run `budget-analyze run --summary` to verify improvement
5. Repeat until Unknown < 5% of total

The `discover` command provides suggested patterns and merchant names to speed up this process.

## Pattern Syntax Quick Reference

The Pattern column uses Python regex (case-insensitive):

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `NETFLIX` | Contains "NETFLIX" |
| `DELTA\\|UNITED` | "DELTA" or "UNITED" |
| `UBER\\s(?!EATS)` | "UBER " not followed by "EATS" |
| `COSTCO(?!.*GAS)` | "COSTCO" without "GAS" |
| `^ATT\\s` | Starts with "ATT " |

## Common Categories

- **Food**: Grocery, Restaurant, Fast Food, Coffee, Delivery
- **Shopping**: Online, Retail, Clothing, Electronics, Home
- **Travel**: Airline, Lodging, Car Rental
- **Transport**: Rideshare, Gas, Parking
- **Subscriptions**: Streaming, Software
- **Health**: Gym, Pharmacy, Medical
- **Bills**: Rent, Mortgage, Insurance, Utilities
- **Transfers**: P2P, CC Payment

## Travel Detection

International transactions are automatically classified as travel.
Domestic out-of-state is NOT auto-travel (opt-in via merchant rules).

To mark a domestic location as travel, add to merchant_categories.csv:
```csv
.*\\sHI$,Hawaii Trip,Travel,Hawaii
```

## Important Notes

- Statement files in `data/` contain PII - never commit or display raw contents
- First matching rule wins - put specific patterns before general ones
- Test patterns at regex101.com (Python flavor)
- The tool auto-cleans prefixes like APLPAY, SQ*, TST*

## Data Format Requirements

The tool supports multiple data formats:

### Predefined Types
- **AMEX**: CSV with Date,Description,Amount columns (`type: amex`)
- **BOA**: TXT with "MM/DD/YYYY Description Amount Balance" per line (`type: boa`)

### Custom Format Strings
For any other CSV, use the `format` field with a format string:

```yaml
data_sources:
  - name: Chase
    file: data/chase.csv
    format: "{date:%m/%d/%Y}, {_}, {description}, {_}, {amount}"
```

**Format string tokens:**
- `{date:%m/%d/%Y}` - Date column (with strptime format)
- `{description}` - Description/merchant column
- `{amount}` - Amount column
- `{location}` - Optional location column
- `{_}` - Skip column

Use `budget-analyze inspect <file>` to see the CSV structure before creating a format string.

See AGENTS.md for detailed examples of creating format strings.

NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Export your bank/credit card statements to:
   {target_dir}/data/

2. Edit settings to add your data sources:
   {target_dir}/config/settings.yaml

   Example configuration:
   ```yaml
   year: 2025
   data_sources:
     - name: AMEX
       file: data/amex-2025.csv
       type: amex
     - name: BOA Checking
       file: data/checking.txt
       type: boa
   ```

3. Run the analyzer:
   budget-analyze run

================================================================================
STATEMENT FILE FORMATS
================================================================================

AMEX (CSV):
  Export from American Express website. Expected columns:
  Date,Description,Amount
  01/15/2025,AMAZON.COM,-45.99
  01/16/2025,STARBUCKS STORE 12345,-6.50

BOA (TXT):
  Export from Bank of America. Space-separated format:
  MM/DD/YYYY Description Amount Balance
  01/15/2025 NETFLIX.COM DES:RECURRING -15.99 1234.56

================================================================================
MERCHANT CATEGORIZATION
================================================================================

Edit config/merchant_categories.csv to add patterns for your merchants.

Format: Pattern,Merchant,Category,Subcategory

Pattern Syntax (Python regex, case-insensitive):
  NETFLIX              Contains "NETFLIX"
  DELTA|SOUTHWEST      Matches "DELTA" OR "SOUTHWEST"
  UBER\\s(?!EATS)       "UBER " not followed by "EATS"
  COSTCO(?!.*GAS)      "COSTCO" without "GAS" anywhere after
  ^ATT\\s               Starts with "ATT "

Common Categories:
  Food:          Grocery, Restaurant, Fast Food, Coffee, Delivery
  Shopping:      Online, Retail, Clothing, Electronics, Home
  Travel:        Airline, Lodging, Car Rental
  Transport:     Rideshare, Gas, Parking
  Subscriptions: Streaming, Software
  Health:        Gym, Pharmacy, Medical
  Bills:         Rent, Mortgage, Insurance
  Transfers:     P2P, CC Payment

Tips:
  - First match wins - put specific patterns before general ones
  - Run 'budget-analyze run --summary' to find Unknown transactions
  - Test patterns at regex101.com (Python flavor)
  - Lines starting with # are comments
